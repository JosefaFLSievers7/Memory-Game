# Overview

Having a solid foundation in various programming languages is essential for achieving different goals based on your specialization or field of work.

I developed a simple memory game using the JavaScript programming language.

The purpose of this code is to reinforce the fundamentals of this programming language, including the use of the DOM and libraries that simplify code creation.

# Development Environment

I use many functions for the JavaScript code, to create de cards, find the matching pairs, and flip the cards when the player selects a card. I also use a library called Loadash, this tool helps me shuffle the cards every time the player starts the game.

For this assignment I use the JavaScript Language
